# LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

I wanted to learn how to use LINQ in C# and practice using methods such as `GroupBy` and `Select`. LINQ is query syntax in C# that allows us to retrieve data from different sources and formats. 

I found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq"this</a> documentation helpful when learning.
